# Argos-Quadruped-Robot
ARGOS source code

Quadruped robotics has always been a strong area of interest for me. During a recent course, I began the development of my own quadruped system (ARGOS) from the ground up. Given the complexity of such a project and the constraints of a single semester, certain design trade-offs were necessary. However, development is ongoing, and future plans and revisions are extremely exciting.
